## Which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.

_how many games need: {red < 13, green < 14, blue < 15 }_

now, since there's no rule for the number of dices that can appear at once, nor an span, nor about the frequency, this can't be an absolute problem, but an statistic one, since

_**in absolute terms is possible to have an infinite number of possible and/or impossible games**_

## _So..._

No thanks
